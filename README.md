## WP User Listing Table
This is a WordPress plugin that provides a front-end portal to preview the users being fetched from a remote API. It uses WP custom rewrite rules to create the page and uses `wp_remote_*` functions to call the remote API, and also provide an admin options page to be able to adjust some settings.
